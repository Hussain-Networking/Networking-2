EXTENDED AND STANDARD ACL EXPLANATION 
================================================

ACCESS CONTROL LIST (ACL)

An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules used on Cisco routers to control traffic.
ACLs decide whether packets are permitted or denied when entering or leaving an interface.

There are two main ACL types:
- Standard ACL
- Extended ACL

--------------------------------------------------
STANDARD ACL

A Standard ACL filters traffic based ONLY on the source IP address.

It does NOT check:
- Destination IP address
- Protocol type
- Port numbers

Because of this limitation, Standard ACLs are simple but dangerous if placed incorrectly.

PLACEMENT RULE:
Standard ACLs should be placed as close to the DESTINATION as possible.

REASON:
Blocking traffic near the source may unintentionally block access to other networks.

STANDARD ACL NUMBER RANGE:
1–99 and 1300–1999

CISCO STANDARD ACL EXAMPLE:

Block host 192.168.10.50 from accessing a network.

Router(config)# access-list 10 deny host 192.168.10.50
Router(config)# access-list 10 permit any

Apply the ACL to an interface (inbound or outbound):

Router(config)# interface g0/0
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 10 out

--------------------------------------------------
EXTENDED ACL

An Extended ACL provides detailed traffic control.
It can filter traffic based on multiple parameters.

Extended ACL can match:
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
- Port numbers (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, etc.)

PLACEMENT RULE:
Extended ACLs should be placed as close to the SOURCE as possible.

REASON:
Blocking unwanted traffic early saves bandwidth and improves security.

EXTENDED ACL NUMBER RANGE:
100–199 and 2000–2699

CISCO EXTENDED ACL EXAMPLE:

Allow HTTP traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 to server 10.10.10.10
Block all other traffic from that subnet.

Router(config)# access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 10.10.10.10 eq 80
Router(config)# access-list 110 deny ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any

Apply the ACL near the source:

Router(config)# interface g0/1
Router(config-if)# ip access-group 110 in

--------------------------------------------------
IMPLICIT DENY

All ACLs end with an implicit deny statement.

This means:
Any traffic that does NOT match a permit rule is automatically denied.

That is why ACLs often break connectivity if permit statements are missing.

--------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY

Standard ACL:
- Matches source IP only
- Simple but limited
- Placed near the destination

Extended ACL:
- Matches source, destination, protocol, and ports
- Precise and secure
- Placed near the source
