# Networking 2 — Complete Study, Labs, and Teaching Material

This repository contains my **Networking 2 course material**, structured for **teaching, learning, and real understanding**, not memorization.

It combines:
- Concept explanations
- Packet Tracer labs
- Configuration demos
- Troubleshooting scenarios
- Structured revision material

The approach is practical and engineering-focused:

**Understand → Build → Verify → Break → Fix → Revise**

By the end, a learner can design, configure, verify, and troubleshoot a routed and switched network with services and edge connectivity.

## Project Objective

This repository supports a **full Networking 2 curriculum**, delivered through:
- Concept-based YouTube videos
- Configuration and demo videos
- Packet Tracer labs for every topic
- Troubleshooting-first thinking
- Exam-oriented revision material

**Final outcome:**  
A learner can think and operate like a junior network engineer, not just pass an exam.

---

## How Each Topic Is Handled

Every topic in this repository follows the same rule:

- One concept explanation
- One configuration / demo
- At least one Packet Tracer lab
- Verification and troubleshooting steps
- Clear learning outcomes

No topic is considered complete without a **working lab and verification**.

- Default routes
- Administrative distance (conceptual)

Outcome:
You can read routing tables and manually control packet paths.

---

### MODULE 6 — Dynamic Routing Protocols

#### EIGRP
- Neighbor relationships
- Metrics
- AS mismatches

Outcome:
You can configure, verify, and troubleshoot EIGRP.

#### OSPF
- Link-state logic
- Area 0
- Neighbor and area mismatches

Outcome:
You can configure single-area OSPF and fix common issues.

---

### MODULE 7 — DHCP
**Focus:** Automatic IP addressing

Topics include:
- DORA process
- DHCP server vs relay
- Helper-address issues

Outcome:
You can deploy DHCP across multiple subnets and diagnose failures.

---

### MODULE 8 — NAT
**Focus:** Private-to-public address translation

Topics include:
- Inside vs outside interfaces
- Static NAT
- Dynamic NAT
- PAT (Overload)

Outcome:
You can configure, verify, and troubleshoot NAT in real scenarios.

---

### MODULE 9 — PPP & PPPoE
**Focus:** WAN connectivity (IMPORTANT)

Topics include:
- WAN concepts
- PPP vs HDLC
- PAP and CHAP authentication
- PPPoE client/server operation

Outcome:
You can configure authenticated PPP links and understand ISP-style PPPoE access.

---

### MODULE 10 — Integration & Troubleshooting
**Focus:** Real-world thinking

Topics include:
- End-to-end traffic flow
- Network design logic
- Systematic troubleshooting

Outcome:
You can integrate all Networking 2 topics and troubleshoot complex, broken networks.

---

## Packet Tracer Lab Standards

Every Packet Tracer lab includes:
- Topology diagram
- IP addressing table
- Clear objectives
- Required commands
- Verification steps
- At least one intentional failure

Labs are designed to teach **why things break**, not just how to configure them.

---

## Revision & Exam Preparation

This repository also includes:
- Revision notes per module
- Command recap sheets
- Exam-style scenarios
- Final full-network troubleshooting lab

Designed for fast review before exams or interviews.

---

## Tools & Environment
- **Packet Tracer** (primary student labs)
- **EVE-NG** (advanced and extended labs)
- **Cisco IOS CLI**
- Verification-driven troubleshooting (`show`, `debug`, packet flow)

---

## Disclaimer
This repository contains **my personal teaching material, labs, and revision notes** based on hands-on practice and understanding.

It is **not official course material**.  
Always follow your institution’s syllabus and assessment requirements.
